# DevOps Internship – Task 4: Shell Scripting Basics (Bash)

## Objective
To learn Bash shell scripting fundamentals and automate repetitive DevOps tasks using scripts, variables, conditionals, loops, permissions, and output redirection.

## Tools Used
- Bash Shell
- Ubuntu VM (Vagrant)

## Tasks Completed
- Created shell script files and added shebang line (`#!/bin/bash`)

- Used variables, conditionals, and loops in scripts
- Automated basic tasks like log cleanup and backup
- Made scripts executable using `chmod +x`
- Redirected script output to files

## Deliverables
- ✅ Shell Script Files:
  - `system-info.sh`
  - `backup.sh`
  - `log-cleanup.sh`
- ✅ Execution Proof:

## Final Outcome
After completing this task, I gained hands-on experience writing Bash scripts to automate repetitive DevOps tasks and improve operational efficiency.
